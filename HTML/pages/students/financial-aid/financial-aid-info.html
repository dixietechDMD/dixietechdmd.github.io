            <h3>Eligibility</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">The amount of your Pell Grant eligibility is determined by the Department of Education. They use a need-based formula, which assigns students an index number that is called an “Expected Family Contribution (EFC)”. This index number reflects the amount a student is expected to contribute to his or her own education costs. Once an index number gets above a certain range you will no longer qualify for a Pell Grant. The Dixie Applied Technology College (College) does not participate in federal student loan programs. If you do not qualify for federal funding you may apply for secure funds from private or public agencies outside the College (Dept. of Workforce Services, Division or Rehabilitation Services, Mountain America Credit Union, Wells Fargo Bank, etc.). </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Determining and Activating an Award</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">f you are eligible for financial aid, the financial aid office, DXATC will be notified by our third party administrator, DJA administration and provide you with an Award Letter. Three conditions must be met in order for you to activate your award. 1) You must be eligible; 2) You must have started school; 3) you must have submitted all required paperwork. Awards cannot be processed prior to your start date because award packages must be date defined. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Disbursement of Funds</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">The Financial Aid Office normally requires up to 90 days from the day you start school (complete all of the required paperwork) to process your aid and to disburse any Title IV refunds (federal aid eligibility that exceeds the direct cost of attending school). However, the Financial Aid Office can provide you vouchers for tuition up to the maximum amount of your eligibility. In addition, if you qualify for adequate funds, book vouchers can also be provided for required books, supplies, and curriculum on the first day of class. All disbursements of aid represent payment made in advance of training. Dollars are earned by attending and completing courses. If you complete a course early, you can only be paid for the hours you attended for that course. For this reason you should speak with a counselor about your options for testing out of courses in which you already have the necessary skill. If you withdraw before completing the hours you have been paid for you are at risk for overpayment with the Department of Education or may owe money to the school. Amounts owed to the College that are not recovered will be referred to State of Utah for collection. <strong>You can only receive Federal Financial Aid at one school at a time</strong>. You must notify the Financial Aid Office if it is your intention to transfer to another school. You must officially stop your federal aid at DXATC before accessing aid at a new school. If you fail to do this, any costs that accrue or Federal Aid overpaid are your responsibility. In keeping with federal grant regulations, the College pays federal grant funds in increments called payment periods. Payment periods are defined by federal regulation and are determined by your program length, the academic year of your program, and for students receiving aid in more than one year, the remainder of the program. There is no federal aid for students enrolling as less than half-time students. Because the College requires a student to complete their designated program within 3 years to earn a Certificate of Completion the College does not allow less-than-half-time students to enroll as Certificate Seeking students.</p><br>
            <h3>Evaluation Schedule</h3>
            <p>The College evaluates eligibility for payment upon receiving latest DJA reports.</p>
            <p class="long-copy">Once you qualify to receive a disbursement, the financial aid office will pay all estimated tuition and fee charges for the entire payment period and any other charges you have authorized us to pay. If you have funds remaining after these charges have been paid the school will release this Title IV refund to you dependent on the following criteria: first disbursement will be awarded when you have achieved 67% progress in your given program. Additional disbursements will be awarded by maintaining 67% progress and remaining in good academic standing. Students may choose to have their funds mailed, mailed to the last known address on file with Student Services) or picked up at the cashiers office. You are responsible for updating address information directly with the Student Services Office. Funds returned undeliverable will be sent back to the Department of Education. Tuition and fees are charged at the beginning of each course, not for an entire payment period. To ensure adequate funding is available for the entire payment period the Financial Aid Office will withhold enough aid to cover those costs and place them in your student account. Any funds remaining at withdrawal or at the end of the payment period will be provided to you as part of a Title IV refund calculation (see Early Withdrawal – Return to Title IV).</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Attendance Requirements</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">The Financial Aid Office recommends that your attendance be 80% or higher. It is our experience that students with attendance less than this often fail to meet the progress requirements. In addition, federal aid funds are earned through school attendance and progress but costs are assessed by the scheduled hour , therefore, lower attendance means your tuition costs will remain constant but we will be unable to pay you for non-attended hours possibly leading to a deficit of funding for tuition costs. The absolute minimum attendance allowance is 67%. If your attendance is less than 80% you will receive a courtesy warning. This warning is only to alert you of the potential risk of low attendance. If your attendance falls below 67% your aid will be suspended. Once your aid has been suspended you can regain eligibility by getting your cumulative attendance to 67% and maintaining it at that rate. You are only eligible for payment in the payment period in which you regain eligibility – not for any prior payment periods. Please note that progress standards must also be met in order to be considered for reinstatement. Attendance standards for prior enrollment periods will count towards your current federal aid eligibility for five years from the date of your last withdrawal. You could be required to serve a non-paid probation period, if you had demonstrated poor attendance habits in a prior enrollment period that impacted your aid eligibility at that time, regardless of the time frame.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Progress Requirements</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">The College progress standard requires that you be able to complete your program in no more than one and one-half times the length of the program. In order to accomplish this, your cumulative progress must be 67%. The financial aid office will monitor individual student progress at every payment period. If you are maintaining satisfactory progress you will have completed 67% or more of your work at each progress increment. For example, at hour 675 you must have completed 450 hours or more of competency. If you fail to complete the work required to be making satisfactory progress by the end of the payment period you will lose the disbursement for the following payment period. Once your aid has been suspended you can regain eligibility by getting your cumulative progress to 67% and maintaining it at that rate. You are only eligible for payment in the payment period in which you regain eligibility – not for any prior payment periods. Please note that attendance standards must also be met in order to be considered for reinstatement. Progress standards for prior enrollment periods in the same program will count towards your Federal aid eligibility for five years from the date of your last withdrawal. If you have enrollment prior to applying for federal aid and your progress in the same program is below 67%, you will be required to meet satisfactory progress standards before your financial aid will be activated. In addition, the office may require you to serve a non-paid probation period, if you had demonstrated poor progress in a prior enrollment period that impacted your aid eligibility at that time, regardless of the time frame. Non-paid probation periods are always one full payment period.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Completion</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">The College model of competency based learning can result in your completing your program in fewer hours than the length of the program. Federal Aid can only be earned for hours you actually attend the program. If you finish your program in fewer hours, you will be paid for fewer hours. Because the College encourages early completion, when possible, the Financial Aid Office is committed to providing you funding to cover the tuition and fee expense up to the amount your federal aid would have paid, if you had not completed early. The College does not provide funding for indirect school expenses (room, board, transportation, or miscellaneous costs). </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Program Changes</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">Students will be allowed two program changes (three programs) in a three-year period. In the event that a student is seeking funding for coursework previously funded, the student must show just cause that the technology has changed enough to render the training obsolete. Time cannot be the only factor involved in the request unless the coursework is more than five years old.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Withdrawl - Return to Title IV</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">When students withdraw from school before completing the period of enrollment they have been paid for, they are subject to the DXATC Financial Aid policy on Return to Title IV. The Financial Aid Office will conduct a calculation to determine how much of the aid was earned. Any funds not earned must be returned to the Department of Education. If the student received more funds than they are entitled, they are considered overpaid. Those funds must be paid back to the Department of Education directly and students will lose their financial aid eligibility until those funds are repaid. If the college must return unearned aid that was used to pay direct school costs accrued by the student, the College will return those funds to the Department of Education and bill the student for any outstanding charges.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Scholarships</h3>
            <p class="long-copy">Dixie Applied Technology College scholarships may be awarded to students based on previous educational accomplishments and career goals or based on their needs. Scholarships are to be used to further fund their educational needs at the college. All scholarships will be awarded to selected students upon enrollment and completed scholarship application at the College. All applications are available in Student Services.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy"><strong>Need Based Scholarship: </strong>Need-based scholarship applications are accepted at any time and require verification of your need. To apply, submit a Need Based Scholarship application along with a letter explaining your current financial situation and why you should be considered.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy"><strong>Merit Based Scholarships: </strong>Merit-based scholarship applications are accepted at any time. To apply, submit a Merit Based Scholarship application along with a letter explaining why you should be considered, include any applicable documentation (awards, certifications, school transcripts, etc.).</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy"><strong>Bridge Scholarship: </strong>provides scholarship funding to High School Senior’s for the summer after High School graduation. The program is primarily intended to allow students attending while in High School an opportunity to finish their program during the summer. Funding is only available from June to August. Students must specify their intended schedule at the time of application and are only funded up to that level. Priority is given to High School students who attend the College while in High School who can complete their program during the summer. Students need to be making satisfactory progress and attending adequately to qualify for these funds. Bridge Scholarship applications are available after the High School Senior Scholarship deadline. </p><br>
            <p class="long-copy"><strong>Eligibility: </strong>In order to be awarded any type of College Scholarship, students must be a U.S. Citizen or a Legal Resident Alien. Some scholarship awards can only be provided to Utah State Residents. Students on scholarship must maintain satisfactory progress (67%) and attendance (85%) at all times while attending the College. Some programs require higher rates of progress or attendance. These program requirements will be considered when making selections or evaluating continued eligibility. Failure to maintain satisfactory progress or attendance can result in automatic withdrawal of the scholarship.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy">A Student can be awarded no more than two scholarships within a 12-month period. Applicants will be notified in writing of their selection status within 10 days following their selection. Students receiving notification of an award must officially accept the scholarship by notifying the Financial Aid office, in writing, of their intention to do so within 30 days of the posted date.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy">Scholarships are normally only available for programs that are regular, on-going technical College programs that lead to an approved, Certificate of Completion. Exceptions can be granted on a case-by-case basis for need-based awards, but only if you can establish the program leads to gainful employment or licensing. All requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing to the Financial Aid office.</p>
