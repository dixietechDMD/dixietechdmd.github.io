            <h3>Student Code of Conduct</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="long-copy">Students attending Dixie Applied Technology College (DXATC) shall conduct themselves in a manner consistent with customary standards of employment.  Faculty and staff of DXATC are committed to providing all students a positive learning environment where employment skills can be learned in a safe atmosphere.  Consistent with this philosophy, is the general expectations that fellow students, faculty, and staff are to be treated in a polite, respectful manner.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Cheating: </strong>Cheating is a serious offense and will be punished by penalties that are deemed appropriate by administration.  Repeat offenses are punishable by penalties including expulsion from the College.  Plagiarism is considered a form of cheating.</p><br>

            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Dress Code: </strong>Students should dress appropriately for the occupational environment for which they are training and to start acquiring wardrobes suitable for employment. Clothing should be appropriate for safety and effective performance of tasks in the area of training in which they are enrolled.  Dress code may vary between training programs. Clothing must be clean and shall not be immodest, obscene, or create a hostile training or work environment for other individuals or themselves.  While it is not our intention to tell students how to dress, there are a few guidelines that we expect DXATC students to follow:</p><br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 60px;">
                <li>Shirts and shoes are to be worn at all times.</li>
                <li>Clothing should not be revealing or offensive as to cause disruption of normal college and classroom activities.</li>
                <li>Both the individual and his/her clothes should be clean so as not to offend others.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Harassment: </strong>Conduct that has the purpose or foreseeable effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s educational performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or learning environment for that individual.  DXATC will abide by the following:</p><br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 60px;">
                <li>The College is committed to providing students an environment that is free of discrimination and harassment.

            </ol><br>
            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 90px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment; or</p><br>

            <p class="long-copy">A student’s record of conduct may be considered when determining the appropriate sanction to be imposed. Minor infractions occurring within programs will normally be handled by the program instructor or department head.

            </ol><br>
            <h3>Student Grievance Procedure</h3><br>
            <p class="long-copy">Dixie Applied Technology College strives to maintain a positive and professional learning environment for its students. This standard of excellence is monitored on an ongoing basis. Open communication is essential in resolving issues of contention. Students are therefore strongly encouraged to discuss and to work out any difficulty or misunderstanding with the particular instructor or staff member with whom that situation exists.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy">Should you have cause for concern in this area, you are encouraged to follow the procedure listed below in a timely manner:</p><br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 60px;">
                <li>An attempt should be made to resolve the disagreement at an informal level among the parties involved.</li>
                <li>If you cannot resolve the issue at an informal level, you have the right to submit a grievance to the Vice President of Instruction for resolution. Formal grievances must be submitted in writing by the student to the Vice President of Instruction within ten days of the incident. The complaint, including a list of witnesses with first-hand knowledge and/or understanding of the issues involved, must be signed, dated and submitted at this time. Other parties to the grievance may also submit a statement responding to the grievance with witnesses listed.</li>
                <li>The Vice President of Instruction or his/her designee will meet with the parties involved to resolve the issue.  The Vice President of Instruction or his/her designee will provide a written statement of resolution to the parties involved within ten days of the meeting.</li>
                <li>If this decision is disputed by either party, they may appeal the decision in writing to the Director of Student Services within ten days stating their reasons for the appeal.  All relevant information will then be forwarded within one working day to the Director of Student Services.</li>
                <li>An appeal shall be limited to a review of the records of the initial hearing, supporting documents from which the decision was made, and any additional new evidence. The Director of Student Services or his/her designee will review:</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 90px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the original hearing was conducted fairly in light of charges and evidence presented, and in conformity with prescribed grievance procedures.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 90px;">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the decision reached was based on substantiated evidence.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy" style="padding-left: 90px;">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether any sanction imposed was appropriate.</p><br>
            <p class="long-copy">*New evidence must be sufficient to alter a decision, or it will not be considered during the appeal.</p><br>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;" class="long-copy">vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Student Services or his/her designee will review the complaint and render a recommendation within ten days of hearing the complaint to the Campus President. The student will receive a written response from the Campus President. The decision of the Campus President is final.</p><br><br>
            <p class="long-copy">A copy of all written grievances and appeals will be placed on file at the College.</p><br>
