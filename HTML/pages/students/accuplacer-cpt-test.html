            <p class="long-copy"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: The Accuplacer CPT Test is a “Computerized Placement Test” designed to provide you with useful information about your academic skills in Arithmetic, Sentence Skills (English grammar) and Reading Comprehension.
            You cannot “pass” or “fail” the CPT, but it is important to do your best so that you and Dixie Tech will have an accurate measure of your academic skills. We HIGHLY encourage you to prepare by reviewing sample questions and brushing up on your skills before the test. Being unprepared may needlessly increase educational costs and time need to complete your coursework. Preparation is always smart!
            If you find that you do not place where you would like to on the CPT, Dixie Technical College has options—refresher classes or a self-paced online course option are here to assist you in becoming fully prepared to succeed in your desired course of study. Your success is our common aim.</p><br>
            
            <p class="long-copy"><strong>COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TESTING</strong> The Accuplacer CPT is an “adaptive” test. This means that the questions are chosen for you on the basis of your answers to previous questions. This technique selects just the right questions for your ability level. Because the test works this way, you must answer every question when it is first given. Each test is untimed so that you can give each question as much thought as you wish. You can change your answer to a particular question before moving on to the next question, but you cannot leave a question out or come back to it later to change your answer. If you do not know the answer to a question, try to eliminate one or more of the choices. Then pick from the remaining choices. For more info on how the test works, go <a href="https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/">here</a></p><br>
            
            <p class="long-copy"><strong>SECTIONS:</strong> The Accuplacer CPT has three sections:</p><br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">

                <li><strong>REVIEW</strong>: Take some time on your own to review the concepts that gave you trouble (see “Preparation Resources” that follow.) Then retest.</li><br>
                <li class="long-copy"><strong>REFRESHER</strong>: Refresher classes are offered through DXATC CATAPULT Training. There is no cutoff for enrollment in CATAPULT. So those who fall below the DXATC Program enrollment scores will be considered. However, prospective students may be referred to local literacy programs if they fail to meet minimum literacy requirements. Your Student Advisor has a schedule of CATAPULT classes.</li><br>
                <li class="long-copy"><strong>CPT LAB</strong>: DXATC now offers the "CPT LAB", a self-paced, online personalized course that will allow you to focus on the areas where you need extra help. To sign up, you will need to talk to the Student Advisor, who can enroll you. Tutoring is available for CPT LAB students at the DXATC Main Campus (please make an appointment with Debi Barmonde, see contact info. below). However, you are free to do your work whenever and wherever works for you, at your own pace. Let your Student Advisor know if this is a good solution for you. The cost is about $140 for the 10 week course, which can be renewed if needed.</li><br>
                <li class="long-copy"><strong>iPHONE/iPAD APP</strong>: There is an app for that! For $2.99 you can purchase the Official Accuplacer Study App on iTunes. For Math help, Khan Academy also has a great FREE app on iTunes.</li><br>
                <li class="long-copy"><strong>RETEST</strong>: You can retake the Accuplacer CPT test weekly for $10 per test. But please study so that you will show an improvement!</li>
